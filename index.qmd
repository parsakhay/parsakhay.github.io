Hi! My name is Parsa Khayatzadeh. I am a Ph.D. student in Systems Engineering at Cornell University. I am a member of Charles' research group, focusing on computational sustainability under the supervision of Prof. Michael Charles. My current research focus is on Integrated Assessment modeling.

I have started my Ph.D. in fall 2023. Before then, I received my B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from University of Tehran in 2022.

I am interested in the human-earth models and the intersection of climate, economy, and society. My study includes both systems analysis and optimization.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would like to collaborate on a project. I am always open to new ideas and opportunities!
